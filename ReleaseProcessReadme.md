# Release Process
The Shouldly release process is pretty easy now, there are two small manual steps to give you a chance to edit release notes.

Deployments are initiated through AppVeyor, navigate to the build you want to deploy at [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shouldly/shouldly](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shouldly/shouldly), then press the `Deploy` button.
